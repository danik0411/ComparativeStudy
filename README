# this README file is written by Daniyar Bakir

the structure of this project is as follows:

data/ - folder with databases as .txt files
src_experiments_C++/ - folder with all source codes required to run the comparison experiments. They are mostly written by Professors, and slightly modified by me (Daniyar Bakir)
src_experiments_C++/Makefile - a makefile written by Professors
data_analysis.R - an .R file which computes Gene Expression Omnibus
checkNat.sh - a file that can run all experiments on Natsoulis database, you can find the main command to run a single experiment here
README - this readme


NOTES:
1) in order to read the databases from a custom folder, look through the checkNat.sh file to change the database folder
2) to save the results and logs into default folders, you should create the logs and results folder in the root directory
